# quick-start-to-javascript-volume-

We learn more methods of control flow like switch statements, for loops, and while loops. 
We'll learn how to create reusable commands with functions, store values in arrays, and how to use a loop with an array. 
We will also learn how to create JavaScript files from scratch, and how to create a plan and break down code into steps so we 
can make it easier to write code of our own. We'll finish up this JavaScript training by creating a more complex version of our 
zombie text adventure game from [Volume 1 ](https://github.com/rickadams2/quick-start-to-javascript-volume-1_bg_ps)
